# ScaleNSTextField

Scaling an NSTextField  acording to the pixel size of the screen thats going to full screen mode.

it gets the size and posion of the NsTextField  in % of the NSview itÂ´s in,
and scales the NSTextFiled with that giveing % of the full screen vie.

The view dos not use autolayout, it just dident scale the NSTextField the way i wanted.


i made a simpel demo that  uses a NSTextField to show the current time.


feel free to use it in your projects.
